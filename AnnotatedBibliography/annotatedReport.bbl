 \begin{quotation}\noindent WCAG guidelines are made for developers to have a
  list of technical requirements to meet ADA compliance. Content must be
  perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. The Domino's website was
  not perceivable by the blind, and so it didn't meet WCAG guidelines. WCAG 2.1
  is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.0. \end{quotation}

  online, 2003,
  \url{https://onlineethics.org/cases/therac-25/history-introduction-and-shut-down-therac-25/}.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent The Therac-25 was a new version of an existing line
  of machines, for the first time with all safety features being handled by
  software. Several incidents were reported to the manufacturer, AECL, and each
  time they stated there had been no similar incidents. All corrective action
  was minor, without a full investigation. \end{quotation}

  Linear Accelerator},'' online,
  \url{http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/Papers/THERAC25.html}.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent AECL had a lot of misplaced confidence in the
  machine, claiming numerous times that the machine couldn't have been causing
  problems, even as reports of injuries arrived. The software bug-checking was
  insufficient, and after the third accident AECL lied outright about there
  being no other incidents. \end{quotation}

  Inaccessible Website and Orders WCAG Compliance},'' online, June 2021,
  \url{https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/court-finds-domino-s-pizza-violated-the-2182635/}.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent The plantiff alleged that the mobile website
  violated ADA because it was inaccesible to the blind. It was not accessible
  using a screen reader by experts. Domino's argued the website/mobile app had
  no nexus to the physical stores, but this was overturned. \end{quotation}
