The project grew, and the parents faced attempts by the city to take their app/code down, including changing their API to break the app and legal action.

However, if the app had been open source since the beginning, the government could have saved a lot of money. They are worked on by many people, which helps prevent bugs and helps fix issues in a timely manner. On the other hand, because the code is open source, it is more vulnerable to malicious users due to ease of developing exploits. This was one issue with the app, as privacy concerns were certainly valid. },

The bug caused a slight delay in the timing of the defense system, but this delay would continue to increase over time until the system is rebooted. During this incident, the Patriot had already been running for over 100 hours, rendering it completely ineffective. },
